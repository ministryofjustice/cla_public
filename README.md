    source env/bin/activate

    ./manage.py runserver 8001

## Frontend

Assets are managed using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). To compile the assets once, after a pull for example, run:

    gulp build

### Stylesheets

Stylesheets are located in `cla_public/assets-src/stylesheets` and are compiled into `cla_public/assets/stylesheets`. They are written in Sass using the `scss` syntax. To compile the stylesheets run:

    gulp sass

### Javascripts

Javascripts files are located in `cla_public/assets/src/javascripts` and are concatinated into `cla_public/assets/javascripts`. To compile the javascript files run:

    gulp js

### Images

Image are optimised and copied into the `cla_public/assets/images` folder using gulp. Source images should be stored in `cla_public/assets-src/images`. To optimise and copy images into assets run:

    gulp images

### Development

When making frequent changes to the assets you can run a gulp watch command to instantly compile any assets. To watch the source assets, run:

    gulp watch

## Testing

CasperJS is used to run basic functional/browser tests on basic DOM interactions. To run the tests, make sure you have the following dependencies:

* [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) (2.41.0) (Install using homebrew `brew install selenium-server-standalone`)
* [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) (~0.4.14)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (1.9.7)

To run the tests, use the following make command:

    make test

By default, tests will be run on `http://0.0.0.0:8001/`. To change this you can pass the `--url` argument on the command called in the make file. To see what command is called look at the `Makefile` at the project root.
