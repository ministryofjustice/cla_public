  <h1>Check if you can get legal aid</h1>
  <p>Legal aid can help pay for legal advice or family mediation.</p>
  <p>This service will check that your problem is covered by legal aid.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it looks like you can get legal aid, you may be able to get help over the phone or we’ll suggest that you speak to an adviser face to face.</li>
    <li>If it looks like you can’t get legal aid, we’ll point you towards other organisations that offer legal advice, or help you find a solicitor. You will have to pay for the solicitor’s advice.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <a class="button button-get-started" href="{{ url_for('base.get_started') }}" id="start">Start now</a>
  </p>

  {% call Element.alert() %}
    <p>You’ll only get guidance on whether or not you might qualify for legal aid – you won’t get a final decision until you speak to an adviser.</p>
  {% endcall %}

  <p>This service can’t help if you’ve been charged with a crime – ask your solicitor or barrister about criminal legal aid.</p>

  <p>If you’re looking for family mediation, you can also <a href="http://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/" rel="external" target="_blank">find a local mediator</a>.</p>

  {% call Element.alert() %}
    <p>Legal aid is different in <a href="http://www.slab.org.uk/public/advice/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/index/legalservices/legal-services-members-of-the-public.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">Northern Ireland.</a></p>
