  <p>Legal aid can help pay for legal advice.</p>
  <p>This service will check that your problem is covered by legal aid.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it looks like you can get legal aid, you may be able to get help over the phone or we’ll suggest that you speak to an adviser face to face.</li>
    <li>If it looks like you can’t get legal aid, we’ll point you towards other organisations that offer legal advice, or help you find a solicitor. You will have to pay for the solicitor’s advice.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>You’ll only get guidance on whether or not you might qualify for legal aid – you won’t get a final decision until you speak to an adviser.</p>

  <p>This service can’t help if you’ve been charged with a crime – ask your solicitor or barrister about criminal legal aid.</p>
